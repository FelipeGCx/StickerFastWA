# StickerFast WA

StickerFast WA is a desktop app to make sticker packs for Whatsapp, it's built in python using [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com)

# ‚ö† Currently not working

*If you liked this project give me a star*

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes 
- Currently the wemoji packs are invalid (I'm work to fix it)
- Some animated stickers after processing exceed the 500kb allowed, while I find a solution I suggest to unzip the final package, optimize the stickers that exceed the size in [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/optiwebp) and reinsert them.
